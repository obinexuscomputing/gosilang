### Layman’s Explanation of Automaton State Minimization:

Automaton state minimization is about taking a finite state machine (FSM)—which may have redundant states—and simplifying it to use the smallest number of states possible, while still performing the same behaviour. In this case, you’re associating it with minimizing the **abstract syntax tree (AST)**, which is a tree representation of the machine's rules or transitions.

Now let’s formalize the concept mathematically:

### Formal Definition:

1. **Automaton Representation**: Let the automaton AA be represented as a 5-tuple:
    
    A=(Q,Σ,δ,q0,F)A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)
    
    where:
    
    - QQ: Finite set of states.
    - Σ\Sigma: Finite alphabet (input symbols).
    - δ:Q×Σ→Q\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q: Transition function.
    - q0∈Qq_0 \in Q: Initial state.
    - F⊆QF \subseteq Q: Set of accepting (final) states.
2. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: The AST represents the structure of transitions and states in the automaton as a tree. Each node in the tree corresponds to:
    
    - A state q∈Qq \in Q.
    - An input σ∈Σ\sigma \in \Sigma or output transition δ(q,σ)\delta(q, \sigma).
3. **State Equivalence**: Define two states p,q∈Qp, q \in Q as **equivalent** (p∼qp \sim q) if for every possible input sequence w∈Σ∗w \in \Sigma^*, the automaton starting at pp and qq ends in the same type of state (both accepting or both non-accepting).
    
    Mathematically:
    
    p∼q  ⟺  ∀w∈Σ∗,δ∗(p,w)∈F  ⟺  δ∗(q,w)∈Fp \sim q \iff \forall w \in \Sigma^*, \delta^*(p, w) \in F \iff \delta^*(q, w) \in F
    
    Here, δ∗\delta^* is the extended transition function for sequences:
    
    δ∗(q,ϵ)=q,δ∗(q,aw)=δ∗(δ(q,a),w)\delta^*(q, \epsilon) = q, \quad \delta^*(q, a w) = \delta^*(\delta(q, a), w)
4. **Minimization**: The minimization process constructs a new automaton A′=(Q′,Σ,δ′,q0′,F′)A' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F') where:
    
    - Q′Q': Partition of QQ into equivalence classes under ∼\sim.
    - δ′(C,a)=[δ(q,a)]\delta'(C, a) = [\delta(q, a)] for any q∈Cq \in C, where CC is an equivalence class.
    - q0′=[q0]q_0' = [q_0] (the equivalence class containing the initial state).
    - F′={C∈Q′∣C∩F≠∅}F' = \{C \in Q' \mid C \cap F \neq \emptyset\}.
5. **Abstract Syntax Tree Reduction**: The minimized AST is derived from the minimized automaton A′A':
    
    - Nodes correspond to equivalence classes Q′Q'.
    - Transitions are simplified using δ′\delta'.

### Summary:

To minimize an automaton:

1. Identify equivalent states using the equivalence relation ∼\sim.
2. Partition states into equivalence classes.
3. Construct the reduced automaton using the partitions.
4. Reflect the minimized structure in the AST by reducing nodes and transitions accordingly.
